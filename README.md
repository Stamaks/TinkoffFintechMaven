# TinkoffFintechMaven
The project was created for educational purposes. Main class creates a folder with a random name and an empty file in it.

## How to run Main.java
Make sure you have JDK-8 or higher (I have jdk-v10.0.2).

Create new folder "TinkoffFintechMaven", enter it and pull this project with the next command:
```
mkdir TinkoffFintechMaven
cd TinkoffFintechMaven
git init
git pull https://github.com/Stamaks/TinkoffFintechMaven
```
Or just download it and unzip.

Then compile it with *javac*:
```
javac src/main/java/Main.java
java -cp src/main/java Main
```
If everything is ok, a folder with random name will be generated and you'll see this in you terminal:
```
Success!
```
If that is not what you see, than check if you have the rights to creae folders or files in your current folder or with your current user.
